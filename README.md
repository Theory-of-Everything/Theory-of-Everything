Heya, I'm Theory. I'm a Developer, Gamer, Linux Enthusiast and Musician. Most of my time is spent doing school, however when I have time, you can usually find me programming to some degree.

On other notes I enjoy games, mostly indie, but with a few exceptions.

Languages I have used/learned:
- Pythion (although not much anymore)
- C# (most with the Unity Game Engine)
- HTML/CSS

What I am Currently Learning:
- C++
- Rust
- Lua (because configs)
- Shell/POSIX Shell scripting
